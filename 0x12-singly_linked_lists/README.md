# 0x12 Singly Linked Lists

This is a project for the ALX Software Engineering program that involves working with singly linked lists in C. This project is authored by NourMellal.

## Project Description

A singly linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. The first node in the sequence is called the head, and the last node is called the tail.

This project contains several functions that operate on singly linked lists, including:

* **print_list:** A function that prints all the elements of a linked list.
* **list_len:** A function that returns the number of elements in a linked list.
* **add_node:** A function that adds a new node at the beginning of a linked list.
* **add_node_end:** A function that adds a new node at the end of a linked list.
* **free_list:** A function that frees a linked list.

These functions can be used to implement various algorithms that require linked lists, such as sorting, searching, and graph traversal.

## File Description

The project contains the following files:

* **0-print_list.c:** A function that prints all the elements of a linked list.
* **1-list_len.c:** A function that returns the number of elements in a linked list.
* **2-add_node.c:** A function that adds a new node at the beginning of a linked list.
* **3-add_node_end.c:** A function that adds a new node at the end of a linked list.
* **4-free_list.c:** A function that frees a linked list.
* **lists.h:** A header file that contains the function prototypes and struct definition used in the project.
* **README.md:** A readme file that provides an overview of the project.

In addition, there is a folder called "tests" that contains test files for each of the tasks.

## Conclusion

Singly linked lists are an important data structure in computer science and are used in many applications. This project provides an opportunity to practice working with singly linked lists in C and implementing common linked list operations.
