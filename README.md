### AS A PROGRAMMER, WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU GET STUCK?
If you're struggling to find a bug in your code, try reading it out loud as if you were explaining it to a friend. This exercise can help you identify the problem, and if you're still stuck, try asking yourself questions as if you were the friend listening to your explanation. For example, you could ask yourself what each line of code is doing and how it fits into the overall program.

Remember, as a C programmer, you're already skilled in the art of thinking logically and methodically, so don't hesitate to use your mental prowess to debug your code. And don't worry if you feel like you're going crazy â€“ debugging can be a frustrating process, but it's an essential part of software development!


As a bonus, talking through your code also helps you identify which portions need to have comments and what the comments should be.
