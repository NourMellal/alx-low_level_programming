Sure, here's an example of a README file for a directory:

# 0x10-variadic_functions

This directory contains a collection of C programs that demonstrate the use of variadic functions in C.

## Files

The following files are included in this directory:

- `variadic_functions.h`: Header file that contains the function prototypes for the variadic functions used in the programs.
- `0-sum_them_all.c`: Source code file that contains the implementation of the `sum_them_all()` function, which calculates the sum of a variable number of integers.
- `1-print_numbers.c`: Source code file that contains the implementation of the `print_numbers()` function, which prints a variable number of integers separated by a specified character.
- `2-print_strings.c`: Source code file that contains the implementation of the `print_strings()` function, which prints a variable number of strings separated by a specified character.
- `3-print_all.c`: Source code file that contains the implementation of the `print_all()` function, which prints a variable number of arguments of any type.

## Usage

To compile and run the programs, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing these files.
2. Compile the programs by running the following command: `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o program`
3. Run a program by running the following command: `./program`

The program will prompt you to enter the required inputs based on the program you are running.

## Notes

These programs are provided as educational resources to help you understand how variadic functions work in C. Variadic functions can be useful in situations where you need to pass a variable number of arguments to a function. However, they can be tricky to work with, so it's important to understand their limitations and how to use them correctly.

If you have any questions or comments about these programs, feel free to contact the author, Nour Mellal, at mellal.nour9@gmail.com.
