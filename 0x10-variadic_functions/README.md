# 0x10-variadic_functions

This directory contains a collection of C programs that demonstrate the use of variadic functions in C.

## Files

The following files are included in this directory:

- `variadic_functions.h`: Header file that contains the function prototypes for the variadic functions used in the programs.
- `0-sum_them_all.c`: Source code file that contains the implementation of the `sum_them_all()` function, which calculates the sum of a variable number of integers.
- `1-print_numbers.c`: Source code file that contains the implementation of the `print_numbers()` function, which prints a variable number of integers separated by a specified character.
- `2-print_strings.c`: Source code file that contains the implementation of the `print_strings()` function, which prints a variable number of strings separated by a specified character.
- `3-print_all.c`: Source code file that contains the implementation of the `print_all()` function, which prints a variable number of arguments of any type.

## Usage

To compile and run the programs, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing these files.
2. Compile the programs by running the following command: `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o program`
3. Run a program by running the following command: `./program`

The program will prompt you to enter the required inputs based on the program you are running.

## Notes

These programs are provided as educational resources to help you understand how variadic functions work in C. Variadic functions can be useful in situations where you need to pass a variable number of arguments to a function. However, they can be tricky to work with, so it's important to understand their limitations and how to use them correctly.
