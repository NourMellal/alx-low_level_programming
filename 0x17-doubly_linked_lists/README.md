# Doubly Linked Lists - 0x17-doubly_linked_lists

## Description
This project contains the solutions to the problems related to doubly linked lists in the context of the C programming language. It includes various functions and algorithms implemented using doubly linked lists.

A doubly linked list is a data structure in which each node contains a data element and two pointers, one pointing to the previous node and the other pointing to the next node. This allows for efficient traversal in both directions.

The project provides the following files:

- `lists.h`: Header file containing function prototypes and the definition of the `listint_t` structure.
- `0-print_dlistint.c`: Function that prints all the elements of a doubly linked list.
- `1-dlistint_len.c`: Function that returns the number of elements in a doubly linked list.
- `2-add_dnodeint.c`: Function that adds a new node at the beginning of a doubly linked list.
- `3-add_dnodeint_end.c`: Function that adds a new node at the end of a doubly linked list.
- `4-free_dlistint.c`: Function that frees the memory allocated for a doubly linked list.
- `5-get_dnodeint.c`: Function that returns the nth node of a doubly linked list.
- `6-sum_dlistint.c`: Function that computes the sum of all the data (integers) in a doubly linked list.
- `7-insert_dnodeint.c`: Function that inserts a new node at a given position in a doubly linked list.
- `8-delete_dnodeint.c`: Function that deletes a node at a given position in a doubly linked list.
- `100-password`: Text file containing the password for a crackme program.
